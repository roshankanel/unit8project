# Project description/outline

Leaning towards crypto portfolio analyser, that will take desired growth aspirations and return and optimal mix of crypto portfolios and trade time windows.

Initial steps:
- Have an initial tool that tells us how to maximise returns first: what crypto currency mix, what trade time window, etc.
- Create a follow up prototype that takes desired growth % and returns optimal mix/trade window.


Team thinking of a three part approach to the project that we can address based on time availability:
1. Single crypto portfolio Analyser (Prototype)
2. Multi crypto portfolio analyser Analyser (MVP)
3. World wide Multi crypto portfolio Analyser visualiser vs stock indices (nice to have)

**Take an MVP approach to solution**

4. What is the optimal way to conduct siumulations?
